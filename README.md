This repository contains a beginner-friendly C++ program that demonstrates the use of conditional statements such as if, else if, and else. Conditional statements are the foundation of decision-making in programming, allowing a program to execute different code blocks based on given conditions.
In this example, the program takes the age of a person as input and evaluates it using conditions:
If the age is below 18, the person is not eligible to vote.
If the age is between 18 and 34, the person is eligible to vote but cannot contest elections.
If the age is 35 or above, the person is eligible to vote and also contest elections.
Any invalid or negative input is handled with an error message.
This project is designed to help beginners clearly understand the flow of if-else decision making in C++. It also demonstrates how multiple conditions can be chained using logical operators and how branching works in real-life scenarios.
